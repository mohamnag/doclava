## An alternative Javadoc

Javadoc is (or at least may be) the most important asset that any Java 
developer may deliver beside the code and the product. However the current 
state of Javadoc has some drawbacks:

 - it has a drastically outdated look and feel
 - it is not easy to search for information as it is not properly indexable
 - deep linking is a big problem and simply does not work
 
We believe even technical people deserve a modern look and feel in their 
daily work. Therefore this project aims to provide a modern alternative 
for standard Javadoc.

> You can view a sample documentation output [here](sample/). Bear in 
 mind that the code is still in beta status.

## Origins and future

[Doclava](https://code.google.com/p/doclava/) was a javadoc doclet which 
was originally written by Google and used for  Android Developer Docs. 
Clear and efficient.

This project is forked from [kwf2030/doclava](https://github.com/kwf2030/doclava)
and therefore indirectly from [Google's doclava](https://code.google.com/p/doclava/).
 
To get an overview of where this project stands and what it is going to 
be in near future, take a look at [the roadmap](roadmap/).


## Modification and personalisation
This project is planned with flexibility in mind. You should be able to
modify and replace output to the maximum possible extent. Therefore we
have templates. If you want to modify we recommend reading about them 
[in templating guide](templating).


## How to use this lib
> Before trying to use this tool for generation of your own documentation,
it is again important to insist that the code is on a beta stage. 

After obtaining the latest JAR (from [here](https://github.com/mohamnag/doclava/releases), 
you can issue following command to generate your Javadocs:
 
```bash
$ javadoc -encoding UTF-8 \
    -sourcepath path/to/your/project/src/main/java/ \
    -d output/path/ \
    -subpackages your.package.prefix \
    -docletpath ~/Projects/doclava-1.0.6.jar \
    -doclet com.google.doclava.Doclava 
```

You can even download the templates of the same release and modify them
as you like, then use the modified templates by issuing following command:
 
```bash
$ javadoc -encoding UTF-8 \
    -sourcepath path/to/your/project/src/main/java/ \
    -d output/path/ \
    -subpackages your.package.prefix \
    -docletpath ~/Projects/doclava-1.0.6.jar \
    -doclet com.google.doclava.Doclava \
    -templatedir path/to/your/modified/templates/
```
