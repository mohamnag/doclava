# Phase 1
Implementing a new look and feel with existing limitations.

# Phase 2
Fixing lots of data conversions done in templates, making the template 
files only a template and extract data conversions from them.
Fixing not handled Java 8 tags should also be done here.

# Phase 3
Replace templating system with a more widely used one, currently the 
Handlebars are the favourite here. Templates should be rewritten.

# Phase 4 
Add alternate outputs templates like XML, JSON and so on.
