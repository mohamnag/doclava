  "body": "# Alternative Javadoc\r\nJavadoc is (or at least may be) the most important documentation that any Java developer may deliver beside the code and the product. However the current state of Javadoc has some drawbacks:\r\n - it has a drastically outdated look and feel\r\n - it is not easy to find the information as it is not properly indexable \r\n - deep linking is a big problem and simply does not work\r\n\r\nWe believe even technical people has deserved a modern look and feel in their daily work. Therefore this project aims to provide a modern alternative for standard Javadoc.\r\n\r\nYou can view a sample output [here](http://naghavi.me/doclava/sample/). Bear in mind that the code is still in beta status.\r\n\r\n![package details page](./images/package-details-sc.png)\r\n\r\n![packages page](./images/packages-sc.png)",
